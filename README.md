# pAIpesense (Concept)

**Smart IoT & AI-Powered Water Leak Detection (Project Idea)**

## Concept Overview

pAIpesense is envisioned as an intelligent system utilizing IoT sensors and embedded Artificial Intelligence to detect water leaks and pipe damages at an early stage. The project aims to proactively identify issues locally, avoiding potential water damage, reducing maintenance costs, and maintaining infrastructure integrity without relying on cloud-based AI. Due to limited initial data, human oversight is incorporated to manage false positives and facilitate continuous learning. Additionally, pAIpesense is designed to integrate seamlessly with smart home platforms, such as Home Assistant, and function as an agent within multi-agent systems using protocols like the [Language Model Operating System (LMOS)](https://github.com/eclipse-lmos/lmos) for inter-agent communication.

## Future Usage (Concept)

Upon successful development, users would monitor pipes locally via a dedicated web interface, mobile application, or through their smart home platform, receiving real-time alerts about potential leaks or anomalies. Users' feedback will continuously improve the detection accuracy of the embedded AI. Additionally, leveraging the LMOS protocol, the device will securely discover, communicate, and coordinate with other intelligent agents within a smart home or industrial ecosystem.
